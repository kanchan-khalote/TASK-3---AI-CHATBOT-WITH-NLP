# TASK-3---AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP

*COMPANY* : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*DOMAIN* : PYTHON PROGRAMMING

*DURATION* : 6 WEEKS

*DESCRIPTION* :

The objective of this task was to create a simple AI Chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts in Python. The chatbot was designed to understand basic user input and respond intelligently based on predefined patterns. This project demonstrates how text-based interaction between a human and a machine can be implemented using simple NLP techniques.

In this chatbot, I used basic Python libraries such as nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) and regular expressions for tokenization and text processing. The chatbot processes user messages by converting text into lowercase, removing punctuation, and identifying keywords. Based on these keywords, it selects the most suitable response from a predefined set of responses. For example, if the user greets with “hello”, the chatbot replies with “Hi there! How can I help you today?”

This task helped me understand the fundamentals of NLP, such as tokenization, text matching, and response generation. It also introduced me to how real-world chatbots like Siri, Alexa, and ChatGPT are built using more advanced NLP and machine learning models. Even though this was a simple implementation, it gave me a strong foundation for building more advanced AI-driven conversational systems in the future.
